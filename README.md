## Setup Instructions
### Backend (Django)
1. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. Run migrations:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
3. Start server:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### Frontend (React)
1. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```
2. Start development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Deployment
- Backend: Render/Heroku
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages

## API Endpoints
- `/api/register/` - Register new user
- `/api/token/` - Obtain JWT token (login)
- `/api/profile/` - Get/update profile
- `/api/change-credentials/` - Change username/password
- `/api/worldbank/` - Get World Bank data

## Notes
- Settings tab is a placeholder (feature coming soon)
- Password must be at least 8 characters for registration
- All dashboard features require login

## Issues
- If you encounter CORS or proxy issues, ensure frontend `package.json` has:
  ```json
  "proxy": "http://localhost:8000"
  ```
- For deployment, update allowed hosts and CORS settings in Django


## Roadmap / Future Work
- Theme toggle implementation (Dark/Light mode)
- Deployment to Render/Vercel
- Export charts as PDF
- Persist uploaded datasets per user
